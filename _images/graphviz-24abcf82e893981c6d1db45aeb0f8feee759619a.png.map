<area shape="rect" id="node1" title="dsgrid.config.dimension_mapping_base.DimensionMappingReferenceModel

Reference to a dimension mapping stored in the registry.

The DimensionMappingReferenceModel is utilized by the project configuration (project.json5) as well as by the
dimension mapping reference configuration (dimension_mapping_references.json5) that may be required when submitting a dataset to a project.

<area shape="rect" id="node3" title="dsgrid.config.project_config.InputDatasetModel

Defines an input dataset for the project config.

<area shape="rect" id="node4" title="dsgrid.config.project_config.DatasetBaseDimensionNamesModel

Defines the query names for project base dimensions to which datasets will be mapped.
This is important for cases where a project has multiple base dimensions of the same type.
" alt="" coords="1160,325,1449,577"/>
<area shape="rect" id="node5" title="dsgrid.config.project_config.RequiredDimensionsModel

Defines required record IDs that must exist for each dimension in a dataset.
Record IDs can reside in the project&#39;s base or subset dimensions.

Requirements can be specified for a single dimension or a combination of dimensions.
For example, if a project includes commercial, residential, and transportation sectors but the
dataset has only transporation sector records, it should specify a single_dimensional
requirement that is a subset of of the project&#39;s base dimension.
`{&quot;single_dimensional&quot;: &quot;sector&quot;: {&quot;base&quot;: {&quot;record_ids&quot;: [&quot;transportation&quot;]}}}`.

If a dataset&#39;s requirements span multiple dimensions, such as if it does not have some
metric records for some geography records, then a multi_dimensional requirement should be
specified. (By default, a full cross join is assumed to be present.)
`{&quot;multi_dimensional&quot;: {
 &#160;&#160;&#160;&quot;geography&quot;: {&quot;base&quot;: {&quot;record_ids&quot;: [&quot;12345&quot;]}}
 &#160;&#160;&#160;&quot;metric&quot;: {&quot;base&quot;: {&quot;record_ids&quot;: [&quot;electricity_cooling&quot;]}}
 &#160;}
}`

If a dataset specifies a dimension type within a multi_dimensional section and wants to use
all records from a project base dimension, it can specify `base.record_ids = [&quot;__all__&quot;]
as a shorthand notation.

Requirements for a dimension cannot be defined in both single_dimensional and multi_dimensional
sections.

If no records are listed for a dimension then all project base records are required.

It might be easier for a dataset to specify what it does not have rather than what it does have.
In that case, it is recommended to use the RequiredDimensionRecordsModel.base_missing field.
dsgrid will compute the difference of the base dimension records and the base_missing records
to determine the dataset&#39;s required records.

If a project has multiple base dimensions of the same type, the
RequiredDimensionRecordsModel.dimension_name must be specified to identify the base
dimension that contains the record IDs.

If a dataset contains a subset of project base dimension records that are defined in the
project&#39;s subset dimensions, it is recommended to use that specification. dsgrid will
substitute base records for mapped subset records at runtime.

<area shape="rect" id="node6" title="dsgrid.dimension.time.TimeBasedDataAdjustmentModel

Defines how data needs to be adjusted with respect to time.
For leap day adjustment, up to one full day of timestamps and data are dropped.
For daylight savings, the dataframe is adjusted alongside the timestamps.
This is useful when the load profiles are modeled in standard time and
need to be converted to get clock time load profiles.

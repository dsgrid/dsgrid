Defines dataset dimension requirements.

<area shape="rect" id="node2" title="dsgrid.config.project_config.RequiredDimensionsModel

Defines required record IDs that must exist for each dimension in a dataset.
Record IDs can reside in the project&#39;s base or subset dimensions.

Requirements can be specified for a single dimension or a combination of dimensions.
For example, if a project includes commercial, residential, and transportation sectors but the
dataset has only transporation sector records, it should specify a single_dimensional
requirement that is a subset of of the project&#39;s base dimension.
`{&quot;single_dimensional&quot;: &quot;sector&quot;: {&quot;base&quot;: {&quot;record_ids&quot;: [&quot;transportation&quot;]}}}`.

If a dataset&#39;s requirements span multiple dimensions, such as if it does not have some
metric records for some geography records, then a multi_dimensional requirement should be
specified. (By default, a full cross join is assumed to be present.)
`{&quot;multi_dimensional&quot;: {
 &#160;&#160;&#160;&quot;geography&quot;: {&quot;base&quot;: {&quot;record_ids&quot;: [&quot;12345&quot;]}}
 &#160;&#160;&#160;&quot;metric&quot;: {&quot;base&quot;: {&quot;record_ids&quot;: [&quot;electricity_cooling&quot;]}}
 &#160;}
}`

If a dataset specifies a dimension type within a multi_dimensional section and wants to use
all records from a project base dimension, it can specify `base.record_ids = [&quot;__all__&quot;]
as a shorthand notation.

Requirements for a dimension cannot be defined in both single_dimensional and multi_dimensional
sections.

If no records are listed for a dimension then all project base records are required.

It might be easier for a dataset to specify what it does not have rather than what it does have.
In that case, it is recommended to use the RequiredDimensionRecordsModel.base_missing field.
dsgrid will compute the difference of the base dimension records and the base_missing records
to determine the dataset&#39;s required records.

If a project has multiple base dimensions of the same type, the
RequiredDimensionRecordsModel.dimension_name must be specified to identify the base
dimension that contains the record IDs.

If a dataset contains a subset of project base dimension records that are defined in the
project&#39;s subset dimensions, it is recommended to use that specification. dsgrid will
substitute base records for mapped subset records at runtime.

<area shape="rect" id="node1" title="dsgrid.config.dimensions.AlignedTimeSingleTimeZone

For each geography, data has the same set of timestamps in absolute time.
Timestamps in the data must be tz&#45;aware.

E.g., data in CA and NY both start in 2018&#45;01&#45;01 00:00 EST.

<area shape="rect" id="node2" title="dsgrid.config.dimensions.DateTimeDimensionModel

Defines a time dimension where timestamps translate to datetime objects.

<area shape="rect" id="node3" title="dsgrid.config.dimensions.LocalTimeMultipleTimeZones

For each geography, data has the same set of timestamps when interpreted as local clock time by adjusting
for the time zone of each geography.
Timestamps in the data must be tz&#45;aware.

E.g., data in CA may start in 2018&#45;01&#45;01 00:00 PST while data in NY may start in 2018&#45;01&#45;01 00:00 EST.
They are aligned in clock time but not in absolute time.

<area shape="rect" id="node4" title="dsgrid.config.dimensions.TimeFormatDateTimeNTZModel

Format of timestamps in a dataset is timezone&#45;naive datetime,
requiring localization to time zones.

<area shape="rect" id="node5" title="dsgrid.config.dimensions.TimeFormatDateTimeTZModel

Format of timestamps in a dataset is timezone&#45;aware datetime.

<area shape="rect" id="node6" title="dsgrid.config.dimensions.TimeFormatInPartsModel

Format of timestamps in a dataset is in parts, e.g., month&#45;day&#45;hour format,
requiring conversion to datetime.
" alt="" coords="1138,269,1491,465"/>
<area shape="rect" id="node7" title="dsgrid.config.dimensions.TimeRangeModel

Defines a continuous range of time.

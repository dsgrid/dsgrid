# Derived Dataset Concepts

Derived datasets are datasets created by transforming or combining existing dsgrid datasets. Common types of derived datasets include:

- **Growth rate datasets** - Calculate growth rates between time periods
- **Residual datasets** - Compute differences between datasets (e.g., total minus components)
- **Scenario comparisons** - Compare different scenarios or model years

## How Derived Datasets Work

Derived datasets leverage dsgrid's query and transformation capabilities to create new datasets from existing project data. They maintain the dimensional structure of the source data while performing mathematical operations.

## Use Cases

- Computing year-over-year growth rates
- Calculating residuals (unaccounted energy)
- Creating scenario difference datasets
- Aggregating multiple datasets with custom expressions
